### 1. 🤔 What is Git and GitHub?
- **Git** is a distributed *version control system* that allows you to track changes in your code and collaborate with others. 🚀
- **GitHub** is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control and collaboration. It allows you to host your code, manage projects, and build software alongside millions of other developers. 🛠

### 5. 🎁 Acquired by Microsoft

### 6. 📚 Key Git Terminologies
- **Branches**: Lightweight movable pointers to commit objects. The default branch in Git is called master or main.
- **HEAD**: A special reference that points to the current branch or directly to a commit.
- **Staging Area**: A file in the Git directory that stores information about what will go into your next commit.
- **Repository**: A directory where Git has been initialized to start version controlling your files.
- **Working Directory**: The files that you see in your computer’s file system.
- **Commit**: A snapshot of your repository. This is the way to save the state of your project.

### 7. 🕵️ Why Git Takes a Snapshot Instead of Saving Changes?
- Git takes a snapshot of the file instead of saving the changes because it is faster and more efficient. It also allows you to work offline and have a complete history of your project. This can be much faster, especially when dealing with large repositories or when needing to access very old history.
